## Installation

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. If not, you can download and install it from the official Node.js website.

Copy the provided folder structure and files into a directory on your machine.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the project where index.js is located.

Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies (inquirer, readline-sync, fs):

npm install
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the application using the following command:
node index.js
The application will prompt you to enter the text, text color, choose a shape (circle, triangle, or square), and the shape color. Follow the prompts and enter the required information.

After entering all the input, the application will generate an SVG file named logo.svg in the project directory.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
